How to use:
0. Unzip content from the zip archive.
1. Run FIFA 20 and enter main menu
2. Run "Live Editor.CETRAINER" with Cheat Engine. I recommend to use Cheat Engine 6.8.1. https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine/releases/download/v6.8.1/CheatEngine681.exe
3. Activate "Scripts" -> "Database Tables"
4. Happy Editing!

Troubleshoting:
- If you see '??' under "Players Table" then make sure "Database Tables" script is activated. Also, try to reload your career mode save.
