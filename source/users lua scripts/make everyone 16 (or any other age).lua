--- This script will make every player in your career 16. Make a backup save before you apply this just to be safe. Join this discord for help: https://discord.gg/QFyHUxe
--- It may take a few mins. Cheat Engine will stop responding and it's normal behaviour. Wait until you get 'Done' message.

--- How do you change which age gets applied to everyone? Just edit "locale new_bd_value = 152991" change the value (152991) to whatever age you want. 
---    Age codes can be found here: https://www.fifermods.com/fifa-19-age-codes and an age calculator can be found here: https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?y1=1582&m1=10&d1=15&y2=2017&m2=9&d2=29&ti=on
